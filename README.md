# The Millennial Weather App

## Description:

As a new web developer, I always find myself in a mind state of innovation. Starting a challenge from start to finish is really the only way I learn and there's always something to make look better, work for efficient, and write less code. Web developers are constantly sharpening their tools and skills by studying, I found myself wanting more of myself and having the proper tools and skills therefore I made this project in order to demonstrate to myself that I can do this! You will be able to succeed! I went from no knowdledge to some knowledge and I won't stop here neither should you. The tool I was sharpening here are web API and functions. In order to understand these concepts more I made a functioning weather wepage based on what I've learned. I no longer have doubt about these concepts and are learnable if you simply put your mind into it, dive right in and dont't focus on anything until you feel like you are in a good spot. Perseverance is everything!
